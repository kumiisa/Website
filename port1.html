            <span class="quote-mark">"</span>
            <p>
              After reading research articles and journals about Computer
              Science, I realized how big and meaningful this field really is.

            <div class="reflection-block">
              <h3>Initial Understanding</h3>
              <p>
                At first, I used to think it was mainly about programming and
                writing codes, but I now understand that it goes much deeper
                than that. It is about how computers work, how problems can be
                solved using technology, and how all of these connect to our
                everyday lives. What amazes me most is that Computer Science
                started in the 1940s and has grown so much that today it touches
                almost every aspect of our modern world.

            <div class="reflection-block">
              <h3>Creative & Technical Balance</h3>
              <p>
                What stood out to me is how Computer Science is not only
                technical but also creative. It combines math, engineering, and
                science, but at the same time, it requires problem-solving and
                imagination. I find it inspiring that computer scientists do not
                just build machines or write programs—they create solutions that
                make life easier, safer, and even more exciting.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="reflection-block">
              <h3>Understanding the Disciplines</h3>
              <p>
                I also learned about the five major computing disciplines, and
                it helped me see that technology has many different paths to
                choose from. Each of these fields has its own strengths, and I
                think it's important for students like me to figure out which
                one matches our skills and interests.

            <div class="reflection-block">
              <h3>Finding My Path</h3>
              <p>
                Personally, I like how these disciplines show that there is no
                single way to succeed in technology. Whether someone enjoys
                analyzing data, creating hardware, managing systems, or solving
                complex problems, there is always a place for them. For me, it
                makes the field less intimidating and more exciting because I
                can imagine myself finding a role that truly fits me.

            <div class="reflection-block highlight">
              <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
              <p>
                In the end, I realized that Computer Science and the related
                disciplines are not just about computers—they are about people,
                creativity, and making a difference in the world. This
                reflection made me appreciate how technology continues to evolve
                and how much opportunity it creates for us to learn, innovate,
                and improve lives. I feel motivated to explore these areas more
                deeply because I know that whatever path I take, I can be part
                of something meaningful in the digital age.

                Hello, I'm Izabel Karen A. Del Calzada, I am a 19 year old
                freshman in University of San Carlos currently studying BS
                Information Technology. Ever since I was 10, I was already
                exposed to computers and I got to familiarize in using it as a
                tool to explore more in the Tech Industry.

                    <p>
                      I actually have 6 cats! Having cats for me is like having
                      therapists by my side. They help me mentally and
                      emotionally whenever I'm feeling down.

              <h3>Why BSIT?</h3>
              <p>
                I took BSIT because when I studied ICT in my senior high school,
                I got to know a lot about the field and realized that I am
                definitely into programming and also doing hands on in hardware
                servicing. I already have experience in it because I got to
                study the same field for 2 years in my SHS so I think it makes
                me easier to learn a lot in college.
