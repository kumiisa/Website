        <h2>What are Number Systems?</h2>
        <p>
          In computer science, a number system is a way of representing
          numerical values using a set of symbols or digits. The most commonly
          used number systems in computers are the decimal system, the binary
          system, and the hexadecimal system.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="systems-grid">
        <div class="system-card binary">
          <h3>Binary</h3>
          <span class="base">Base 2</span>
          <div class="digits">Digits: 0, 1</div>
          <p>
            A Binary number system has only two digits that are 0 and 1. Every
            number (value) represents with 0 and 1 in this number system. The
            base of binary number system is 2, because it has only two digits.
          </p>

          <div class="digits">Digits: 0-9</div>
          <p>
            Decimal number system has only ten (10) digits from 0 to 9. Every
            number (value) represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 in this
            number system. The base of decimal number system is 10, because it
            has only 10 digits.

          <p>
            Octal number system has only eight (8) digits from 0 to 7. Every
            number (value) represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 in this number
            system. The base of octal number system is 8, because it has only 8
            digits.

          <p>
            A Hexadecimal number system has sixteen (16) alphanumeric values
            from 0 to 9 and A to F. Every number (value) represents with
            0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E and F in this number system. Here A is
            10, B is 11, C is 12, D is 14, E is 15 and F is 16.

        <h2>Significance of Each Number System</h2>

        <div class="significance-card">
          <h3>Binary Number System</h3>
          <p>
            The binary number system matters because it's the language computers
            understand. While we use numbers like 1, 2, and 3 every day,
            computers don't work that way. They can only recognize two states,
            something is either on or off, like a light switch. Binary fits
            perfectly with this, because it uses only two digits: 0 and 1.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            Everything you do on a device, typing a message, watching a video,
            saving a file, is broken down into long strings of 0s and 1s. It
            might seem simple, but this simplicity is what makes computers fast
            and reliable. The processor inside your device follows instructions
            written in binary, memory stores information using binary, and even
            data sent over the internet travels as binary signals.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            What makes binary so significant is that it gives computers a clear
            and consistent way to represent and process information. It's the
            foundation of all digital technology. Without binary, we wouldn't
            have the devices, apps, and systems we depend on every day.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="significance-card">
          <h3>Decimal Number System</h3>
          <p>
            The decimal number system is the one we use every day, it's the
            system we naturally learn as children, the one we use when we count
            money, measure time, or do basic math. It's built on ten digits
            (0–9), which is probably why humans developed it in the first place:
            we have ten fingers, so counting in tens came naturally long before
            computers existed.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            Its biggest significance is that it's intuitive for people. We think
            in tens, we group things in tens, and our entire world, money,
            measurements, calendars, prices, relies on decimal. Because it's so
            familiar, it makes communication, teaching, and understanding
            numbers much easier.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            Even in computing, where machines use binary, decimal still matters.
            Programmers write numbers in decimal when coding, scientists use
            decimal for calculations, and everyday users rely on decimal when
            interacting with technology.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="significance-card">
          <h3>Octal Number System</h3>
          <p>
            The octal number system is a base-8 system that uses the digits 0 to
            7. It isn't something we use in daily life like decimal, and it's
            not as deeply built into computers as binary, but it has its own
            practical importance, especially in older computing systems and
            certain technical fields.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            What makes octal useful is that it acts like a "shortcut" for
            binary. Since one octal digit represents exactly three binary
            digits, it became a convenient way for early programmers and
            engineers to write long binary numbers in a shorter, more readable
            form.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            Even today, octal still shows up in some places. For example, in
            Unix and Linux systems, file permissions are expressed using octal
            values (like 644 or 755).
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="significance-card">
          <h3>Hexadecimal Number System</h3>
          <p>
            The hexadecimal number system is a base-16 system that uses the
            digits 0–9 and the letters A–F. People don't use it in everyday life
            the way we use decimal, but it's extremely important in computing
            because it makes working with binary much easier and much cleaner.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            Hex is basically a more "human-friendly" version of binary. One
            hexadecimal digit represents exactly four binary digits, so long
            strings of 0s and 1s can be rewritten in hex and suddenly become
            shorter, clearer, and easier to understand.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            This makes hexadecimal very useful for programmers, especially those
            dealing with low-level work like memory addresses, machine code,
            color codes, or debugging. For example, the colors you see in web
            design (#FF5733) are written in hexadecimal because it keeps the
            underlying binary values compact and readable.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="analysis-section">
        <h2>Analysis & Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding number systems is essential in the field of computer
          science because they form the foundation of how computers store,
          process, and interpret information. After studying the different types
          of number systems, binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal, I realized
          that what seems like a simple mathematical concept actually plays a
          crucial role in almost every digital device we use today.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
          The binary system, in particular, stood out to me. Before learning
          about number systems, I only knew that computers use "1s and 0s," but
          I didn't fully understand why. The infographic explained clearly that
          binary only uses two digits because it matches the physical structure
          of computers: circuits that can either be ON or OFF. This made me
          appreciate the elegance of binary. Something so simple becomes the
          foundation for complex operations like graphics rendering, running
          apps, and processing data.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
          The decimal system feels the most familiar because it's what humans
          naturally use daily, from counting money to measuring quantities.
          Seeing it listed alongside the other systems helped me understand why
          computer science needs an alternative way of representing values:
          decimal is intuitive for humans, but not efficient for machines. That
          contrast helped me see how technology bridges human understanding with
          machine logic.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
          I also found the octal and hexadecimal systems interesting because
          they act as "shortcuts" for binary. Instead of writing long strings of
          1s and 0s, these systems help programmers express binary more
          compactly. Hexadecimal especially made sense to me once I learned that
          it uses 16 symbols, including A to F. I often see hex values in color
          codes (like #FF5733), but I never knew this came from the hexadecimal
          system. Knowing this makes those everyday encounters feel more
          meaningful.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
          Overall, my reaction to the topic is one of appreciation and
          curiosity. The infographic presented the information in a simple and
          organized way, making it easier to grasp how each number system works
          and why it matters. It made me realize that computer science is not
          just about coding—it's about understanding the logic that powers all
          digital systems. Learning about number systems gave me a deeper
          respect for how computers operate on a foundational level, and it
          encouraged me to explore more topics that explain the "why" behind
          technology. Instead of memorizing digits and bases, I now see number
          systems as a language that connects human thought with machine
          precision.
