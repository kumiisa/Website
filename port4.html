      <h2>What is Computer Hardware?</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">
        Computer hardware refers to the physical, tangible components of a
        computer system that enable it to perform computing tasks. Unlike
        software, which consists of intangible instructions and programs,
        hardware can be physically seen and touched. Hardware and software are
        complementary—a computing device works effectively only when both
        function together.

      <h2>What is Software?</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">
        Computer software refers to a set of instructions or programs that tell
        a computer how to perform specific tasks and operations. Unlike
        hardware, which is physical and tangible, software is intangible but
        essential, as it enables hardware to function effectively. Without
        software, a computer is just an inactive electronic device.

        <p>
          Software is essential because it transforms computers into useful
          tools that can perform a variety of activities—academic, professional,
          creative, and technical. It controls how hardware behaves, supports
          user interaction, and allows individuals and organizations to automate
          work, enhance communication, and store or process large volumes of
          data effectively.

      <h2>Implementation in Different Institutions</h2>

      <div class="institution-card">
        <h3>🏛️ Government Institutions</h3>
        <p>
          Government institutions use specialized hardware and software to
          streamline public services and administrative tasks. Enterprise
          Resource Planning (ERP) software allows integration of various
          processes such as budgeting, payroll, and citizen services. Benefits
          include efficiency, transparency, and better data handling, though
          smaller institutions face cost and training barriers.

      >
        <h3>🏘️ Community Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Some communities adopt cloud computing and thin-client hardware to
          reduce costs. Using low-power computers linked to central servers with
          cloud processing provides better energy efficiency, easier
          maintenance, and scalable services. This approach requires strong
          network infrastructure to work effectively.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div

      >
        <h3>🎓 Educational Institutions</h3>
        <p>
          Schools are major adopters of both hardware and software, focusing on
          supporting student learning. Implementation examples include Intel's
          Classmate PCs in Macedonia and Kerala's IT@School project, which
          replaced costly proprietary software with free and open-source
          software (FOSS). These initiatives demonstrate how effective
          implementation requires both technology and capacity-building for
          educators.

        <h3>🏥 Healthcare</h3>
        <p>
          The healthcare industry is rapidly transforming through technology.
          Hospitals use digital databases, wearables, trackers, and scanners to
          monitor patients accurately. Advanced hardware like CT scanners and
          MRI machines allow non-invasive diagnosis. Software systems like
          Electronic Health Records (EHR) ensure information is secure and
          accessible. AI and VR are improving diagnostics, treatment, and
          training, making healthcare more efficient and precise.
